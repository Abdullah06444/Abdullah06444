<p>Hello! Welcome ðŸ‘‹ to my profile </p>


<p>I'm Abdullah. I have graduated from Computer Engineering of Ankara University. A young engineer who is organized and disciplined, prone to group work, easily adaptable to the environment, and devoted himself to the software development industry. Developing an algorithm for intelligence questions and especially hard-to-solve problems gives me pleasure. </p>


<p>I am trying to improve myself in software and programming and increase my competencies. I am currently trying to learn the necessary information to become a front-end or back-end developer.</p>
